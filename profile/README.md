### Canonical course description

An exploration of technologies and data relationships which power modern web applications. Participating in hands-on activities which require teamwork, students build web applications that incorporate the "full stack," including databases, application programming interfaces (APIs), and public-facing web pages or mobile applications. Students develop a broad knowledge of different development approaches, languages, and design paradigms to learn advantages and disadvantages of technologies and frameworks. During weekly laboratory sessions, students participate in iterative design processes and report progress and technical details through written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

### Learning objectives

* Define the structure of the web application "stack" and describe the meaning and implications of implementing a "full stack" application. 
* Explain the layers of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and describe their relationship to server-side and client-side web applications.
* Develop secure, reliable application programmer interfaces (APIs) using the Representational State Transfer (REST) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) specification(s).
* Model industry standard server security practices such as, but not limited to, firewall, web server, and database configuration. 
* Select solution-appropriate open-source software to implement a “full stack” web application project using server-side and/or client-side rendering frameworks.
